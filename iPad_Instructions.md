Here are the answers to your iPad questions:

### 1. How to hide the iPad System Bar (Status Bar)
Unfortunately, Apple **does not allow** websites (in Safari) to completely hide the status bar (time/battery) or the native "Done" / "X" buttons. This is a security feature of iOS.

**The Solution: "Add to Home Screen"**
This is the **only way** to get a 100% full-screen app experience on iPad.
1.  Open the site in Safari.
2.  Tap the **Share Icon** (Square with an arrow pointing up).
3.  Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.
4.  Name it "MobileMapper" and tap **Add**.
5.  Close Safari and open the **new app icon** on your home screen.
6.  **Result:** The status bar will be black/hidden, there will be NO URL bar, and NO "X" button. It will look and feel like a native app.

### 2. How to use Stage Manager (Second Screen)
To use the "Dual Screen" feature effectively with a projector:
1.  **Requirements:** You need an iPad with an **M1 chip or newer** (iPad Air 5th Gen, iPad Pro 2021+). Older iPads only support *mirroring*.
2.  **Enable Stage Manager:** Open Control Center (swipe down from top-right) and tap the **Stage Manager** icon (looks like a rectangle with 3 dots on the left).
3.  **Connect Projector:** Plug in your HDMI/USB-C adapter.
4.  **Display Settings:** Go to **Settings > Display & Brightness > Arrangement**. Ensure "Mirror Display" is **OFF**.
5.  **Using MobileMapper:**
    *   Open MobileMapper in Safari (or the Home Screen App).
    *   Tap the **"Dual Screen"** button in the top bar.
    *   A new popup window will appear.
    *   **Drag this new window** off your iPad screen and onto the external projector screen.
    *   Now you have the controls on your iPad and the clean output on the projector!

### 3. The "Gray X" Button
This button is forced by Safari when a video plays in fullscreen or when the browser enters its native fullscreen mode.
*   **Fix:** Using the **"Add to Home Screen"** method (Step 1) completely removes this "X" button because the app runs in its own container, not inside the Safari browser UI.

I hope this helps you get the perfect setup! Let me know if you need any more adjustments.
